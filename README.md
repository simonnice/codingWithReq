# State of the application
## Implementation
All of the functionalities of the original application are not implemented due to time constraints.
As such, this version of the application does not pass all of the test cases.
Below you will see a list of the test cases that are not implemented:
1. Test case 3.2 (Although it works for me when testing it manually.
2. Test case 3.4
4. Test case 3.6
5. Test case 3.7
6. Test case 3.8

Total percentage on automated tests = 81%.


## New functionalities
I implemented a way for users to write their own posts and view them for later use, like a personal notebook. The time the posts were made is recorded so that some kind of time keeping can be maintained. The user can also remove posts that are no longer important. Only the users own posts are visible. I have also created new Use Cases and Test Cases for these functionalities to make sure that they work as intended.
